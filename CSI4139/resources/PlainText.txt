Encryption is a technique for transforming information on a computer in such a way that it becomes unreadable. 
So, even if someone is able to gain access to a computer with personal data on it, they likely won’t be able 
to do anything with the data unless they have complicated, expensive software or the original data key.

The basic function of encryption is essentially to translate normal text into ciphertext. 
Encryption can help ensure that data doesn’t get read by the wrong people, but can also ensure that data isn’t 
altered in transit, and verify the identity of the sender.
